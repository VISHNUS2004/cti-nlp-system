## 🔍 Why Enhanced Models Underperformed

### **Analysis of Results**

The enhanced ensemble models showed lower performance (-13% to -45% F1-score drop). This is attributed to:

#### **1. Dataset Characteristics**

- **Small Dataset**: 1,100 samples may be insufficient for complex ensemble methods
- **Class Distribution**: Relatively balanced classes (254-296 samples each)
- **Feature Sparsity**: Text data creates high-dimensional sparse features

#### **2. Model Complexity vs. Data Size**

- **Overfitting**: Complex ensemble models may overfit on small datasets
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom features didn't add significant value
- **Validation**: Simple models generalize better with limited data

#### **3. Baseline Difficulty**

- **Low Baseline Accuracy**: 25-40% suggests challenging classification task
- **Class Similarity**: Cybersecurity threats may have overlapping features
- **Text Quality**: Preprocessed text may have lost discriminative features
