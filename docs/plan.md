## Model Improvements and Additions

### 1. **Threat Type Classifier** (currently basic)

#### Upgrade:

- **Current**: Likely using basic TF-IDF + SVM or Logistic Regression.
- **Upgrade to**:

  - **Fine-tuned BERT** / **ThreatBERT** for classification.
  - Or try **LightGBM/XGBoost** with advanced features.

#### Ensemble Option:

- Combine multiple classifiers (e.g., BERT + TF-IDF model) using **VotingClassifier** or **Stacking**.
- Great for balancing precision/recall in noisy threat reports.

### 2. **Severity Predictor**

#### Add More Features:

- Currently uses keyword-based features from vectorized text.
- Improve by engineering:

  - **IOC count** (IP, CVE, Domain mentions)
  - **Named entity count**
  - **Sentiment scores** (some APTs use emotional language)
  - **Keyword match with known threat severity vocab**
  - **Report length / sentence complexity**

#### Models to Try:

- Ensemble: **RandomForest + GradientBoosting + SVM**
- Or Neural-based: **BERT for Regression** (if you have enough data)

---

### 3. **NER Model Improvements**

#### If you're using spaCy:

- Replace with **HuggingFace Transformers** model like:

  - `dslim/bert-base-NER`
  - `ai4cyber/ThreatBERT-NER`

- Or fine-tune a domain-specific NER on threat texts

## Practical Defense Measures (Beyond Prediction)

### 4. **IOC Extraction → Mitigation Actions**

After extracting indicators like:

- **IP addresses** → Auto block via firewall (e.g., through API)
- **Domains** → Add to a DNS blocklist
- **Hashes** → Integrate with VirusTotal or YARA rules

#### Example Flow:

```plaintext
NER → Detect IP/Hash → Query AbuseIPDB / VirusTotal → Block or Alert
```

We can even:

- Connect to **SIEM tools** (like Splunk)
- Generate **automatic alerts**
- Or write to **firewall config / allowlist blocklist** if deployed in org environment

## Optional Future Enhancements

| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Zero-shot threat classification | Use models like GPT-4 or `facebook/bart-large-mnli` to infer types without retraining     |
| Threat Similarity Matching      | Use **vector embeddings** + cosine similarity to suggest similar past threats             |
| Active Learning Loop            | Let analyst validate outputs and use them to retrain/improve models                       |
| IOC enrichment                  | Enrich IPs/domains via APIs like Shodan, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault                            |
| Threat Kill Chain Mapping       | Map to MITRE ATT\&CK tactics/techniques from text using regex + NER combo                 |
| Time series risk analysis       | If you're analyzing logs/reports over time, plot frequency of threat types or risk scores |

## How Can We Start?

Would you like to begin with:

1.  **Ensemble classification model** for threat types?
2.  **Improved severity predictor** with engineered features?
3.  **Replace NER model** with a ThreatBERT-based one?
4.  **Integrate IOC enrichment/blocking logic**?

You can pick one and we’ll implement step-by-step — I’ll give you the updated scripts and models directly.
