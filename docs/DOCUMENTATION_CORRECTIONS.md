# Documentation Corrections Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **README.md - Incorrect File References**

**Problem:** The main README.md referenced incorrect filenames that didn't match the actual file structure.

**Fixed:**

- Changed `98. DATASET.md` → `DATASET.md`
- Changed `95. REAL TIME INGESTION MODULE.md` → `INGESTION MODULE.md`
- Changed `99. TEST_GUIDE.md` → `TEST_GUIDE.md`
- Updated all quick start guide references to match actual filenames

### 2. **Backend Overview - Outdated Technology Stack**

**Problem:** `02-architecture/5. BACKEND_OVERVIEW.md` referenced Flask as the backend framework, but the actual implementation uses FastAPI.

**Fixed:**

- Updated tech stack from Flask to FastAPI
- Added missing dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLAlchemy)
- Updated API endpoints to reflect current FastAPI implementation
- Added comprehensive health check endpoint documentation

### 3. **Scripts Overview - Severely Outdated**

**Problem:** `02-architecture/1. SCRIPTS_OVERVIEW.md` only documented 2 scripts but there are actually 12+ scripts in the repository.

**Fixed:**

- Added all missing scripts documentation
- Organized scripts into categories (Core Training, Enhanced Training, Data Processing)
- Updated usage instructions
- Corrected input file references

### 4. **Model Enhancement Report - Inaccurate Performance Claims**

**Problem:** `03-models/MODEL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORT.md` claimed accuracy improvements that contradicted actual evaluation results.

**Fixed:**

- Corrected accuracy figures to match actual evaluation results
- Updated threat classification accuracy from ~28% to ~26% (actual best result)
- Updated severity prediction accuracy from ~22% to ~40% (actual best result)
- Added note explaining why enhanced models underperformed
- Clarified that simple optimized models performed better than complex ensembles

### 5. **AI Architecture Document - Unprofessional Format**

**Problem:** `02-architecture/AI.md` contained conversation logs instead of proper documentation.

**Issue Identified:** This file needs complete rewriting to be professional documentation rather than a chat log.

## Consistency Checks Performed

### ✅ **Verified Accurate:**

- API.md endpoints match actual FastAPI implementation
- User Manual technology stack is correct
- Deployment documentation matches docker-compose.yml
- Dataset documentation matches actual data files
- Model documentation matches training scripts
- Testing documentation matches actual test files

### ✅ **File Structure Consistency:**

- All README.md links now point to correct files
- Folder organization matches documented structure
- Quick start guides reference existing files

### ✅ **Performance Metrics Aligned:**

- Model Enhancement Report now matches Academic Justification Report
- Actual evaluation results consistently reported across all documents

## Recommendations for Ongoing Maintenance

### 1. **Documentation Sync Process**

- Update documentation whenever new scripts are added
- Verify file references when files are moved or renamed
- Keep performance metrics consistent across all documents

### 2. **Version Control for Docs**

- Track documentation changes alongside code changes
- Ensure technical specifications match implementation

### 3. **Regular Audits**

- Perform monthly consistency checks
- Validate external links and references
- Update technology stack documentation when dependencies change
