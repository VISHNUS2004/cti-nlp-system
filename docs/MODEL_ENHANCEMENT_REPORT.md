## üìà Performance Improvements

### **Entity Extraction Enhancement**

- **Before**: Only general entities (PERSON, ORG, etc.)
- **After**: Cybersecurity-specific entities with risk scoring

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "entities": {
    "IP_ADDRESS": ["192.168.1.100"],
    "CVE": ["CVE-2021-34527"],
    "MD5": ["d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"],
    "THREAT_KEYWORDS": ["malware", "ransomware", "exploit"]
  },
  "risk_score": 80
}
```

### **Comprehensive Analysis**

- **Before**: Separate, basic analysis
- **After**: Unified analysis with risk assessment

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "overall_risk_score": 75,
  "classification": { "prediction": "Malware", "confidence": 0.85 },
  "severity": { "severity": "High", "confidence": 0.9 },
  "recommendations": [
    "HIGH: Priority security assessment needed",
    "Block identified IP addresses",
    "Apply patches for identified CVEs"
  ]
}
```
